## Network statistics
Data is gathered from [Duino-Coin JSON API](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/revoxhere/duco-statistics/master/api.json) and displayed with help of AJAX/JQuery.
It also shows price graph generated using matplotlib. The graph is available [here](http://93.113.207.71/prices.png).
